//! What a bill adds up to, and the only place that decides it.
//!
//! This exists because the number was previously decided in three places that
//! disagreed. The dashboard called `tax_rate` a percentage and rendered `14%`
//! from a column the backend validated as a fraction `0..=1`, so an admin
//! typing what the label asked for got a 400 and an admin typing `0.14` saw
//! "0.14%" and corrected it back. Online orders skipped tax entirely
//! (`tax_amount: 0`, hard-coded at delivery finalize). And the till's figure
//! was recorded verbatim, so whatever it sent became the books.
//!
//! ## The rules
//!
//! * **Exclusive** — the menu price is net; tax is added at checkout.
//! * **Inclusive** — the menu price is what the customer pays and already
//!   contains the tax; the receipt breaks it out backwards. The two are
//!   consistent by construction: an exclusive bill of 5000 at 14% and an
//!   inclusive bill of 5700 at 14% are the same bill, and this returns the same
//!   `net`, `tax` and `total` for both.
//! * **Service charge** is a percentage of the same base as tax, and is itself
//!   taxable or not per policy. When it is taxable it enters the tax base;
//!   when it is not, it rides alongside untaxed.
//!
//! ## Why `Decimal` and not `f64`
//!
//! CLAUDE.md requires it for currency, and the old `(taxable as f64 * rate)`
//! was a real hazard rather than a theoretical one: `0.07` and `0.145` are not
//! representable in binary floating point, so a rate that is exactly half a
//! piastre lands on whichever side the representation error falls — and the
//! backend and the till, rounding the same bill from different code, could
//! land on different sides. That is a one-piastre mismatch, and with the
//! server now REJECTING mismatches it would be a refused sale.
//!
//! Rounding is half-away-from-zero, matching what `f64::round()` did before,
//! so historical orders re-price to the figures already in the books.
//!
//! ## The two copies
//!
//! The till prices offline, so this logic necessarily exists twice: here and in
//! `MadarRust/src/tax/engine.rs`. They are pinned together by
//! `tax_vectors.json`, a fixture committed to BOTH repos and executed by a test
//! in each. Change the maths in one and that repo's test fails against the
//! other's expectations. Never edit one copy alone.
//!
//! This is the till's copy. It is what prices a cart with no network, so it is
//! also what the server will be asked to agree with when the order replays.
